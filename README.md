## Installation

This project uses a React front end, MongoDB database, Node.js/Express.js server and API. An Apollo Server is set up to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

## Description

When I load the search engine, I am presented with a menu with the options 'Search for Books' and 'Login/Signup' and an input field to search for books and a submit button.

I can search for books without logging in, but in order to add books to my saved books, I must click the Login/Signup menu option to sign up.

When I click the login/signup menu, I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a sign up button

When I enter a valid email address and create a password and click to sign up, then my account will be created and I can log into the site.

After I input the book I am searching for in the search bar, I can click on the 'Save' button on a book and that book's information is saved to my account

When I click on the option to see my saved books I am then presented with all of the books I saved to my account.

When I click on the 'Remove' button on a book, then that book is deleted from my saved books list

I can then click on the 'Logout' button, which will log me out of the site and I will then be presented with a menu with the options Searhc for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.
